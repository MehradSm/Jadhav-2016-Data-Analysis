    "## Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The hippocampus is important for the learning of episodic and spatial memory, but how it coordinates its activity with other memory-related brain structures is not well known. Of particular interest is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), because of its diverse roles in attention, working memory, long-term memory storage and memory-guided decision making. The goal of this project is to investigate whether neural activity is systematically coordinated between hippocampus and PFC during memory-guided decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharp wave ripples (SWR) are a prominent high-frequency hippocampal oscillation linked to memory-guided decision making that occur when an animal is immobile. During a SWR, neurons that were previously active for a particular spatial location in an environment \"replay\" their activity in a compressed sequence, as if the animal were currently moving through the environment. Interestingly, these compressed sequences of neural activity occur in both the forward and reverse direction -- that is, both following a path the animal might have taken through the environment (forward SWR) and retracing a path backwards (reverse SWR). Because these SWR events often occur at critical decision points, during the receiving of reward, or during sleep, they are thought to reflect planning of future actions based on past memories (memory recall) and/or consolidation of rewarded behaviors. Furthermore, reverse replay sequences are modulated by the rate of reward while forward replay are not (Ambrose et al. 2016), suggesting that reverse replay events are more involved in the consolidation of memories during learning whereas forward replays are more important for retrieval of past memories. If this is the case, then we might expect memory information to be transferred from PFC to hippocampus during forward replays -- because of the role of PFC in long term storage of memories -- and memory information to be transferred from hippocampus to PFC during reverse replays -- to consolidate memories during learning.\n",

    "To test this hypothesis, neural activity was simultaneously recorded in PFC (pre-limbic and infralimbic) and hippocampus (CA1 and intermediate CA1) of three rats learning a W-track spatial alternation task (Figure 1a,c). In the task, the rats had to run to the opposite reward well at the end of each arm of the track (left and right arms) while returning to the center well in-between visits to each arm. We analyzed rhythmic local field potential activity occurring during sharp wave ripples in both hippocampus and PFC. \n",

    "## Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there any evidence of increased coordination between PFC and hippocampus during SWR?\n",
    "2. Are there differences in coordination between forward and reverse SWR?\n",
    "3. Is there evidence of directional influence from CA1 to PFC corresponding to forward and reverse SWR?\n",
    "4. Does any of questions 1-3 change over learning?\n",
    "5. How consistent are the results over animals?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results so far\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can detect ripples using the [Frank lab methods](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2016_11_07_Ripple%20Detection.ipynb) (and [power in CA1 reflects an increase in the ripple band](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_21_Replay_Analysis.ipynb))\n",
    "- We can decode ripples using sorted spikes ([but this didn't work well](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_02_09_Sorted%20Spike%20Ripple%20Decoding.ipynb))\n",
    "- We can decode ripples using the [Xinyi's clusterless method](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_20_Clusterless%20Ripple%20Decoding.ipynb))\n",
    "- We can compute a [large number of connectivity measures](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_05_30_Test%20Spectral%20Code.ipynb) and these match the [plots from examples in papers](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_06_13_Test_Spectral_On_Paper_Examples.ipynb)\n",
    "- There are [about the same number of Outbound and Inbound replay events](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_21_Replay_Analysis.ipynb)\n",
    "- There are [more reverse replays than forward replays during learning (days 1-6)](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_21_Replay_Analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "- There are [more forward replays when a novel environment is introduced after learning (days 7-8)](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_21_Replay_Analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "- There is not much coherence in the gamma bands (30-125 Hz) between CA1, iCA1 and PFC\n",
    "- There is coherence in the beta band (12-30 Hz) between CA1, iCA1, and PFC, but this overlaps with the \"sharp wave\" of the sharp wave ripple and might be uninteresting.\n",
    "- There is coherence in the ripple band (150-250 Hz) between CA1, iCA1, and PFC, but this might reflect increased spiking activity in both areas and might be uninteresting.\n",

    "## Things we have not looked at\n",

    "- Detecting ripples using Long Tao's algorithm for better start times\n",
    "- Neuron-neuron connectivity\n",
    "- Ripple-triggered PETHs for all sessions (we looked at these for a single session. [CA1 neurons did increase firing at the start of the ripple for this single session](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2016_10_06_Ripple%20Triggered%20PETH.ipynb)).\n",
    "- Ripple-triggered LFP ERPs for all sessions (again we looked at these for a single session. See [this notebook](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2016_11_07_Sharp%20Wave%20Ripple%20Exploration%204.ipynb) and [this notebook](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2016_10_06_Ripple%20Triggered%20PETH.ipynb). We did not come to any definitive conclusions.\n",

    "### Forward vs. reverse ripples\n",
    "The plots all look pretty noisy, so it is hard to make conclusions. See previous notebooks.\n",

    "### Inbound vs. outbound ripples\n",
    "The plots all look pretty noisy, so it is hard to make conclusions. See previous notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Haven't adjusted for differences in group size in canonical coherence.\n",
    "Canonical coherence is greater for larger groups. The typical way of adjusting for this is by matching the group sizes and bootstrapping in the leftover tetrodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spectral decomposition not converging\n",
    "This could lead to some of the noisiness of spectral granger.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set threshold for minimum number of ripples in a category?\n",
    "I wanted to do an analysis where we only considered ripples classified with a confidence of greater than 80% (relative to the other ripple categories) since this had some interesting results with regard to forward vs. reverse ripple events while learning vs. in a novel environments (see [this notebook]()). However, for certain recording sessions, this results in a low of number of ripples. One option would be to increase the number of tapers, but since ripple events are short (< 100 ms) and our primary frequencies of interest are in the gamma/beta band, we sacrifice a lot of precious frequency resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time to compute ripple decoding reduced by order of magnitude\n",
    "I spent a couple of hours refactoring the ripple decoding code because this often took an hour or longer for each session, representing a significant amount of the computation time. I eliminated some computations that were not necessary when there was no spiking and this led to big speedups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomized initial conditions if Choleskey fails in spectral matrix decomposition\n",
    "The initial guess for the spectral matrix decomposition was failing, particularly when there was only 1 ripple. In the FieldTrip toolbox, they get around this problem by initializing to a random state. This could also be prevented by adding more tapers (and thus more realizations to average over to get a smoother cross spectrum)."
