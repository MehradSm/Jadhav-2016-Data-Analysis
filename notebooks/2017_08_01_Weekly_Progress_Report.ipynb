    "## Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The hippocampus is important for the learning of episodic and spatial memory, but how it coordinates its activity with other memory-related brain structures is not well known. Of particular interest is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), because of its diverse roles in attention, working memory, long-term memory storage and memory-guided decision making. The goal of this project is to investigate whether neural activity is systematically coordinated between hippocampus and PFC during memory-guided decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharp wave ripples (SWR) are a prominent high-frequency hippocampal oscillation linked to memory-guided decision making that occur when an animal is immobile. During a SWR, neurons that were previously active for a particular spatial location in an environment \"replay\" their activity in a compressed sequence, as if the animal were currently moving through the environment. Interestingly, these compressed sequences of neural activity occur in both the forward and reverse direction -- that is, both following a path the animal might have taken through the environment (forward SWR) and retracing a path backwards (reverse SWR). Because these SWR events often occur at critical decision points, during the receiving of reward, or during sleep, they are thought to reflect planning of future actions based on past memories (memory recall) and/or consolidation of rewarded behaviors. Furthermore, reverse replay sequences are modulated by the rate of reward while forward replay are not (Ambrose et al. 2016), suggesting that reverse replay events are more involved in the consolidation of memories during learning whereas forward replays are more important for retrieval of past memories. If this is the case, then we might expect memory information to be transferred from PFC to hippocampus during forward replays -- because of the role of PFC in long term storage of memories -- and memory information to be transferred from hippocampus to PFC during reverse replays -- to consolidate memories during learning.\n",

    "To test this hypothesis, neural activity was simultaneously recorded in PFC (pre-limbic and infralimbic) and hippocampus (CA1 and intermediate CA1) of three rats learning a W-track spatial alternation task (Figure 1a,c). In the task, the rats had to run to the opposite reward well at the end of each arm of the track (left and right arms) while returning to the center well in-between visits to each arm. We analyzed rhythmic local field potential activity occurring during sharp wave ripples in both hippocampus and PFC. \n",

    "## Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in answering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there any evidence of increased coordination between PFC and hippocampus during SWR?\n",
    "2. Are there differences in coordination between forward and reverse SWR?\n",
    "3. Is there evidence of directional influence from CA1 to PFC corresponding to forward and reverse SWR?\n",
    "4. Does any of questions 1-3 change over learning?\n",
    "5. How consistent are the results over animals?\n",

    "- We can detect ripples using the [Frank lab methods](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2016_11_07_Ripple%20Detection.ipynb) (and [power in CA1 reflects an increase in the ripple band](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_21_Replay_Analysis.ipynb))\n",
    "- We can decode ripples using sorted spikes ([but this didn't work well](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_02_09_Sorted%20Spike%20Ripple%20Decoding.ipynb))\n",
    "- We can decode ripples using the [Xinyi's clusterless method](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_20_Clusterless%20Ripple%20Decoding.ipynb))\n",
    "- We can compute a [large number of connectivity measures](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_05_30_Test%20Spectral%20Code.ipynb) and these match the [plots from examples in papers](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_06_13_Test_Spectral_On_Paper_Examples.ipynb)\n",
    "- There are [about the same number of Outbound and Inbound replay events](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_21_Replay_Analysis.ipynb)\n",
    "- There are [more reverse replays than forward replays during learning (days 1-6)](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_21_Replay_Analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "- There are [more forward replays when a novel environment is introduced after learning (days 7-8)](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_03_21_Replay_Analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "- There is not much coherence in the gamma bands (30-125 Hz) between CA1, iCA1 and PFC\n",
    "- There is coherence in the beta band (12-30 Hz) between CA1, iCA1, and PFC, but this overlaps with the \"sharp wave\" of the sharp wave ripple and might be uninteresting.\n",
    "- There is coherence in the ripple band (150-250 Hz) between CA1, iCA1, and PFC, but this might reflect increased spiking activity in both areas and might be uninteresting.\n",

    "- Detecting ripples using Long Tao's algorithm for better start times\n",
    "- Neuron-neuron connectivity\n",
    "- Ripple-triggered PETHs for all sessions (we looked at these for a single session. [CA1 neurons did increase firing at the start of the ripple for this single session](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2016_10_06_Ripple%20Triggered%20PETH.ipynb)).\n",
    "- Ripple-triggered LFP ERPs for all sessions (again we looked at these for a single session. See [this notebook](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2016_11_07_Sharp%20Wave%20Ripple%20Exploration%204.ipynb) and [this notebook](https://github.com/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2016_10_06_Ripple%20Triggered%20PETH.ipynb). We did not come to any definitive conclusions.\n",

    "### Single session deep dive\n",
    "\n",
    "I picked a single session and tried to verify that each step in the analysis was working as expected. For plots, see this [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/edeno/Jadhav-2016-Data-Analysis/blob/develop/notebooks/2017_07_31_Single_Session_Deep_Dive.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ripple detection appears to work as expected. All ripples are > 0.015 seconds with an average duration of approximately 0.060 seconds. At the time of ripples, the animal is running < 4 cm/sec. The ripples mostly occur at reward locations with the center well being the most frequent ripple location. Power increases in the ripple band (150-250 Hz) during the ripple as expected. Interestingly, power increases in CA1 tetrodes before iCA1 tetrodes, suggesting the areas might have different ripple start times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the spectral connectivity analysis, I first verified that the correct time windows around ripples were being selected and that the event-related potential was being subtracted. Then I looked at the coherence magnitude, canonical coherence, group delay, and pairwise spectral granger prediction for each tetrode pair in the ripple band.\n",
    "\n",
    "As when all the sessions are aggregated, the coherence magnitude between individual pairs of tetrodes is small, particularly between areas where the greatest coherence value is approximately 0.30. Canonical coherence between areas is small as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group delay and spectral granger look similar to the session aggregated results. Group delay is noisy and spectral granger is mostly zero. It is not clear if the cross spectral matrix factorization in the spectral granger has converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I tried to focus on a single tetrode pair to try to get a better sense of what was going on. This analysis was also inconclusive, but I at least verified that the spectral power that my code computes is similar to scipy's function.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had read that the cross spectral matrix factorization works best with a smooth cross spectral density so I tried adding more tapers. This looked promising -- the cross spectral matrix factorization converged and the spectral granger gave more plausible looking results. Unfortunately, for the lower frequencies this doesn't work because ripples are short in duration (< 0.100 seconds) and time-frequency tradeoffs in resolution make it hard to determine what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I looked at the phase of the coherency for each ripple as we discussed. I wasn't sure what information was to be gained from this plot, but it is in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in another attempt to validate the code, I looked at the low frequency bands for the entire session, focusing on the well known theta rhythm. I verified that a strong theta rhythm exists in CA1, iCA1, and PFC as previously observed in other studies (although iCA1 is new). Theta coherence between CA1, iCA1, and PFC tetrodes is also prominent. My canonical coherence code showed a coherence magnitude of 1 for all brain areas, which needs to be debugged. Similarly, the group delay returned all NaNs. The group delay is probably a result of overly strong multiple comparisons corrections, but I'm not sure what's wrong with the canonical coherence, since it seemingly worked on the ripple-locked data and simulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixing session aggregation when a covariate level doesn't exist\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are thresholding by confidence in ripple classification, some recording sessions do not have a ripple of a particular type (e.g. some `outbound` ripples, but no `inbound` ripples). This is currently causing problems for my code that averages over sessions. I have worked out a partial solution, but new problems have sprung up, so this is still a work in progress."
